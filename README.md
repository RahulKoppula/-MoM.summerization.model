# Audio Transcription & Summarization AI

Overview
This project is an end-to-end pipeline for automatically transcribing speech from audio files and generating concise, readable summaries of the content. It leverages advanced open-source models—including OpenAI’s Whisper for accurate speech-to-text transcription and Hugging Face BART for abstractive summarization.

Features

    Upload and transcribe audio files (WAV, MP3, etc.) to text with robust multi-accent/language support.

    Automatic formatting of raw transcripts into readable sentences.

    AI-powered summarization that condenses lengthy audio content into key bullet points.

    Efficiently handles long recordings with intelligent text chunking for summarization.

    Fully reproducible workflow in Python—ideal for research, education, or rapid prototyping.

    Easily customizable: swap out models, add a simple web UI via Streamlit, or deploy to Hugging Face.

Tech Stack

    Python (Colab/Jupyter-friendly)

    Whisper (speech-to-text)

    Transformers (summarization)

    NLTK (text processing)

    (Optional) Streamlit (web app interface)

    Hugging Face Hub (for sharing models)

Getting Started
Clone the repo or use the provided Colab notebook. Upload your audio file, run the cells, and instantly get both a transcript and a concise summary.
